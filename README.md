# Custom-CMS-System
CMS System for my personal needs. I think its to early to use ASP.NET CORE and for now will be at ASP.NET MVC, Razer View Engine, Kendo UI, Entity Framework and if there is a time i will use Ninject for dependency injection and SignalR for realtime binding. 
For Template i think the most functional one is AdminLTE 2.0 https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview
